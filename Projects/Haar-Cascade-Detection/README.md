# Haar-Cascade Classifier

## Theory

Object Detection using Haar feature-based cascade classifiers was first proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their paper, "Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features" in 2001. 
It is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained on positive and negative images and is then used to detect objects.

Pre-trained models are used when performing object detection through Cascade Classifiers. In this case, we will be using - `haar_cascade_frontalface_alt.xml`
